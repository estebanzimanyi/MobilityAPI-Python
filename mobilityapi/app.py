"""FastAPI application factory for the MobilityAPI Dispatcher framework.

Exposes the catalog-driven Dispatcher + WireCodec foundation (steps 3 / 4
of the ingestion plan) as HTTP routes. Two router groups:

- ``/catalog/*``    — read-only introspection (list functions, fetch one).
- ``/functions/*``  — invoke a MEOS function from a JSON request body.

The app is built by :func:`create_app`, which takes injected
``Dispatcher`` and ``WireCodec`` instances. Production wires both to
PyMEOS; tests pass stubs.  No global singletons; every dependency is
explicit, which keeps the request-time hot path resolver-agnostic and
the test surface fast.

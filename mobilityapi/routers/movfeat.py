"""OGC API – Moving Features read routes generated over the MEOS dispatcher.

The "pure MEOS round-trip" resources — the temporal-geometry sequence and its
derived velocity / distance queries, and a stored temporal property — are
served by dispatching the matching MEOS function from the vendored catalog
through the ``Dispatcher`` + ``WireCodec``, then shaping the MF-JSON result as
the OGC envelope. The collection / feature lifecycle, persistence and the
GeoJSON envelope have no MEOS equivalent and stay hand-written.

OGC resource → MEOS catalog function (the alignment map):

    tgsequence (export)        → temporal_as_mfjson
    tgsequence/{tg}/velocity   → tpoint_speed
    tgsequence/{tg}/distance   → tpoint_cumulative_length
    tproperties/{name}         → temporal_as_mfjson

``acceleration`` returns 501: with linearly interpolated position the speed is
piecewise-constant, so its derivative is zero within each segment and undefined
at the vertices; the value is not approximated.

A ``FeatureStore`` port abstracts the database read so the routes are testable
with stubs; production wires it to PyMEOS + psycopg2. Writes (sub-trajectory
append, temporal-property creation) remain on the hand-written path until the
catalog's input-function shapes are confirmed against a live MEOS.
